# Alpha Components

Alpha components are experimental features that are under active development. They are available for testing and feedback but may undergo significant changes before reaching stable release.

Alpha components:
- **Are functional** but may have incomplete features or edge cases
- **May have breaking API changes** in future releases without following semver
- **Are open for feedback** - please report issues or suggest improvements

## Current Alpha Components

- [Bullet](./Bullet.md) - Bullet charts for displaying KPI progress against targets

## Importing Alpha Components

Alpha components are imported from a separate `alpha` export:

```jsx
import { Bullet } from '@adobe/react-spectrum-charts/alpha';
```

## Providing Feedback

If you use alpha components and have feedback, please:
- Open an issue on GitHub
- Share your use case and requirements
- Report any bugs or unexpected behavior

Your feedback helps shape these components for stable release.
